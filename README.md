# SummerTech Blockchain

## Specification

### Data Structure

Unlike most other cryptographically secured digital currencies, the SummerTech blockchain does not make use of a single central blockchain, but a collective of multiple interlacing directed acyclic graphs belonging to the users of the aforementioned currency. Futhermore, the SummerTech blockchain makes use of an overarching distributed "coordination chain" containing lookup metadata regarding each of the interlacing sub-chains.
